# RTOS Kernel Projects

## Overview  
This repository contains a collection of RTOS-based projects developed on STM32F4xx microcontrollers. The projects focus on understanding task scheduling, inter-task communication, and the use of STM32 registers through hands-on kernel development. These exercises aim to enhance practical knowledge of embedded systems, real-time operations, and FreeRTOS concepts.

## Key Features  
- **Task Scheduling**: Implements priority-based and round-robin scheduling.  
- **Communication Mechanisms**: Uses semaphores, mutexes, and message queues.  
- **Interrupt Handling**: Custom ISRs for efficient interrupt management.  
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation using FreeRTOS heap.  

## Project Structure  
-**Kernel Modules**: Core RTOS components, task management, and timers.
-**Communication Protocols**: Integration with UART, SPI, and I2C protocols.
-**Interrupt Management**: Implementation of ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines).
-**Memory Management**: Uses dynamic memory with FreeRTOS heap management.
